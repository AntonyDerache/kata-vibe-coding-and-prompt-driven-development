# Craftsmanship rules

- Respect eslint file
- Write unit tests
- Write integrations tests
- Name of variables, fonctions, interfaces, type, classes are all explicite
- Respect of single responsability principle (SRP)
- Avoid code duplication
- Architecture using reusable, isolate and testable components
- Separate logic/domain code in separate ts file and not in the rendering file
- Write graceful errors and do not leave technical errors to the user
- Use Sass instead of regular css for styling
